# Welcome on Photoflop
this is a very early version of the project, features are not merged yet.
However you can still test them one by one by going to the branch of the
feature you would like to test and using 'make [feature name]'
there are 4 of them:
-gui (this branch)
-filters
-selection
-drawings
Have fun using photoflop !
